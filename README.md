# Fraud-Detection-in-Healthcare-Charges
Worked in Jupyter Notebook - Python Libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit Learn, Pyod PCA and KNN)

The objective of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically PCA and KNN, to identify unusual data points in a dataset. By comparing and analyzing the results from these algorithms, we aim to assess their effectiveness in detecting outliers and gain insights into exceptional data patterns for potential business implications.
